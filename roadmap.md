# Roadmap

## Service credentials and Telegram operations
- [ ] Inventory configured secret names and service dependencies without exposing values.
- [ ] Define Telegram admin scope and secure credential entry outside chat; only authorized provider failover, never quota evasion.
- [ ] Implement and verify approved administrative alerts and credential-pool failover; pending Telegram mode and connection.

## Agent voice messages and avatar changes
- [ ] Complete call cancellation/error recovery, recoverable catalogue loading and durable automatic bot voices; verify real account behavior.
- [x] Remove speech buttons below text replies and move real voice/language preferences into agent settings; saved Arabic preference read back from the real account.
- [x] Implement automatic user language, distinct bot voices, recording-aware replies and private cached audio. Real Arabic voice-message playback verified; 18 targeted tests passed.
- [x] Remove star avatars and vary bot shapes; mobile/desktop screenshots and recording playback verified without page errors.
- [ ] Verify an actual new agent reply delivered as a voice message; blocked by missing Cerebras configuration. User recordings are stored on the sending device, not synchronized as audio files.
- [x] Handle missing chat dependencies as explicit terminal error events instead of page-level 503; real recording submission retained the screen and showed a persistent alert. 13 regression tests passed.

## Cartesia voice connection
- [x] Connect authenticated Cartesia voice catalogue and speech generation, keeping credentials private.
- [x] Add voice/language choice, playable downloadable replies, and microphone recording support in current chat/calls.
- [x] Test real Arabic/English generation, endpoint security and playback; 60 tests pass. Recorded speech was transcribed and sent through the signed-in call UI. See docs/cartesia-verification-2026-11-07.md.
- [ ] Verify a complete new agent reply spoken during a call; blocked by the previously missing agent-response provider configuration. Calls currently use explicit record/stop turns, not full-duplex live audio.

## Seven deep performance investigations and free voice services
- [x] Complete seven independent source investigations and signed-in mobile/desktop performance measurements.
- [x] Identify measured causes separately from unverified candidates and document prioritized remedies in docs/performance-and-voice-2026-11-07.md; no performance changes applied in this diagnostic request.
- [x] Compare official AI voice free allowances, Arabic support and account/payment limitations; provider connection and audio quality are not verified.

## Full verification and real computer — current request
- [x] Sign in and check real home/history, settings, pricing, memory and Vault save/read-back; current chat failed on missing Cerebras configuration. See current verification report for exact coverage.
- [x] Repair account-loading recovery, unsafe execution and misleading controls; add regression tests, repeat affected live checks, and harden legacy source guards.
- [ ] Restore current chat/web/integration configuration; blocked on the owner's existing provider connections/credentials.
- [ ] Connect isolated computer execution; blocked on authorized execution-provider configuration and owner-scoped integration.
- [ ] Finish agent-mediated file/group/delegation, voice/native/payment/scheduled tests; blocked on service/owner/platform configuration.
- [ ] Verify legacy security fixes on the hosted backend and rotate the exposed provider credential; user-managed deployment/provider access unavailable here.
- [ ] Complete transactional onboarding, /chat/not-found routing, canonical/legal review and legacy guest-memory/model-input security repairs.
- [x] Record tested outcomes, source-versus-hosted distinction and remaining limitations in docs/current-verification-2026-11-07.md.

## Pricing and Vault reference redesign
- [x] Match pricing layout and selection controls to the supplied screenshots without changing prices or payment behavior.
- [x] Match Vault categories, list and add-item forms to the supplied screenshots while retaining account-scoped safe storage.
- [x] Verify mobile/desktop appearance in an isolated rendering of the actual components; plan switching, safe card-label add and search passed, along with nine existing tests. Real-account checks remain unavailable for the external unmanaged backend.

## Complete audited gaps — current request
- [x] Repair persistent memory; imported fact persisted after reload and was recalled through signed-in chat.
- [x] Send actual text/code/CSV/JSON contents; uploaded CSV read correctly and downloaded contents matched. Binary image/video/PDF analysis remains blocked on a supported analysis service.
- [x] Reject empty/exhausted completions, retain delegation transcripts and align job-ID polling. Two specialists returned 209.75 and 50; combined answer persisted after reload.
- [x] Connect daily/weekly routine creation, management and signed execution; a due routine produced a persisted chat answer, duplicate invocation did no work, unsigned invocation returned 401.
- [ ] Automatic routine scheduling and durable jobs after app closure require a reachable published endpoint and configured scheduler/Inngest credentials; manual signed routine execution is verified.
- [x] Make Vault account-scoped and enforce last-four-only card labels; validation tests passed. Local Vault is not a password or credential store.
- [ ] Connect actual computer/code execution; blocked until an isolated execution service is available.
- [ ] Activate Google Play purchases; blocked on signed Android app, Play products and verification credentials.
- [ ] Verify external account actions; blocked on account-owner OAuth approval.
- [ ] Verify marketing and inbox delivery; blocked on recipient consent/campaign content and inbox confirmation.

## Full live audit — 2026-11-07
- [x] Sign in to the supplied test account; exercise chat, team creation, simple delegation, complex research and computer requests through the live UI.
- [x] Review settings, memory, integrations and remaining app features; all 38 existing tests passed.
- [x] Record evidence and incomplete features in `docs/live-audit-2026-11-07.md`; this audit did not repair application code.

## Google Play and owned-domain email
- [ ] Configure Android billing for package `si.ceyo.app`; real activation requires Play product IDs, authorized purchase verification, and a signed Android application.
- [x] Store Hostinger SMTP settings as secrets and add an operator-only script to configure native Supabase Auth with read-back verification.
- [x] Activate Hostinger verification email on hosted Supabase Auth; settings applied and read back, OTP send accepted.
- [ ] User confirms the verification email arrived in the inbox from support@ceyo.si.
- [ ] Marketing mail via owned Hostinger mailbox remains separate from Auth and subject to provider limits; campaign sending is not configured.

## Ceyo executable agents
- [x] Make the chat composer smaller and hide its inner scrollbar.

- [x] Authenticated bot/group creation and simple delegation checked using the supplied test account; Gmail authorization card rendered.
- [ ] Complete integration OAuth and real execution: account-owner authorization is required; not performed during the audit.

- [x] Run targeted message, tool-input and steering tests.

- [x] Fix old chat loading character and keep sent messages visible during history refreshes; four targeted tests passed. Authenticated live-chat verification is unavailable for the external unmanaged backend.

- [x] 13 targeted tests passed; public Tasks and inline Crypto navigation checked on mobile without runtime errors.
- [ ] Real transfer and authenticated read-back: unavailable without a real payment/session; other networks are disabled pending reliable verification.
- [ ] X follow and ORANGE purchase rewards: require X account verification and cryptographic wallet ownership proof; opening links never grants points.
